Final versions: 
readssh2b
readncom8b, readncomccs8b

-----------------------------------------------------------------
readncom3: readncom2.f90 without imposing min. salinity.
readncom4: readncom3.f90 with dfv etc. added in hotstart.in (v1.2h2 onwards).
readncom5: readncom3.f90 with new hybrid v1.3a v-grid and hotstart.in format. 
readncom5b: readncom5 with additional input blend.gr3 to blend NCOM with a simple profile 
            (for i.c. e.g.).
readncom6: readncom5 with min. salinity=33psu below 4m.
readncom7: readncom5 with ELCIRC format (test02k2.f90) included.
readncom7b: readncom7 with depth (ht) & smin added in date.in (changed to include equality in z<=-ht).
readncom7c: readncom7b with new hotstart format of v4.1a (added tsel). 
readncom7d: readncom7c with transition of temperature for 2 anchors as well.
readncom7e: readncom7d with hotstart.in modified for ELCIRC v5.4 (upwind). 

readncom8a: readncom7e, modified for MPI SELFE v2.0f up (unformatted binary). 
            (1) Added u,v outputs (on open bnd; use gen_uv3D.f90 to get uv3D.th);
            (2) reallocate arrays each iteration to deal with size change in NCOM in time.
readncomccs8a: for NCOMCCS; 0.5 day output for nudging files. Added u,v outputs (on open bnd;
               use gen_uv3D.f90 to get uv3D.th).
readncom8b, readncomccs8b: added non-hydrostatic pressure in hotstart.in (v3.0 and up). Updated 
            readncom8b for ivcor=1.
readncom8c: readncom8b with i.c. for T,S below a depth calculated using a profile at a node.
            Also calcualted bottom index for SELFE.

readssh: read SSH from NCOM.
readssh2: readssh with (outputs Z0 for v1.3j)
          (1) interpolation back-up (average) if 1 or more nodes are dry in parent;
          (2) multiple days and output only the open bnd part at the beginning and end of period;
          (3) read from nrldata_links instead to fill gaps
readssh2b: readssh2 for v1.3i5 and for the start of the run only.
readssh2c: readssh2 for v1.3m2 (Z0.th for all days).
readssh2d: readssh2c with different output format (for input into gen_elev3D.f90).
readssh2d_ccs: readssh2d for NCOMCCS. Also outputs Z0 at the start of the run.

analyze_ncom1: for reading NCOM and output time series.
analyze_ncomccs1: for reading NCOM-CCS (twice daily data) and output time series.
