The grid2lanxml.pl script converts a .gr3 file to LandXML format which is readable by ArcGIS using the 3D analyst tool:

ArcToolbox->3D Analyst Tools->Conversion->LandXML to TIN

The grid is imported as a constrained Delauney triangulation. This conversion does not set the projection, 
that will have to be done with ArcCatalog. The resulting TIN will need to be added as a layer.

Obviously the depth values of the grid can be any quantity of interest.

Here is a python script that can be modified to batch convert TINs in LandXML to ArcGIS TINs - works from the ArcMap Python window:

# Batch convert TINs
import arcpy
from arcpy import env
arcpy.CheckOutExtension("3D")

# location of xml files
inputdir = "inputdir"
env.workspace = inputdir
# location of output TINs
outputdir = "outputdir"

year = 2001
for var in ["elev", "avgvel", "avgsalt", "avgtmp", "avgcombinedVT", "avgcombinedSVT", "drydays"]:
    for month in range(1,12):
        item = ('''habop-%4d-%02d-%s''') % (year, month, var)
        print item
        try:
            d = arcpy.LandXMLToTin_3d(inputdir+"/"+item+".xml", outputdir+"/", item, "hgrid")
        except:
            print item+" conversion no good."
