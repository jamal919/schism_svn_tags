R4403: removed all '.6?' in output name list and appended '_side' and '_elem' for native outputs;
R4309: added 'gen_wsett' if USE_GEN for settling vel.
R4207: moved starting time info from sflux_inputs.txt and bctides.in to param.in. 
       sflux_inputs.txt now must NOT have this info (i.e. usually empty with only section headers);
       The 1st line of bctides.in is now for comments only.
       Changes in param.in: sim_[year,month,day]->start_[year,month,day] (integers); 
       removed sim_[minute,second]; 'start_hour' as double; added 'utc_start' (double);
R4116: changed all binary inputs to nc: *_[23]D.th =>*_[23]D.th.nc; [MOD]_nu.in =>[MOD]_nu.nc,
       hotstart.in => hotstart.nc. New version now needs netcdf4.4* and higher to compile 
       (also you only need -lnetcdff on some systems, not -lnetcdf).

R3098: removed 'nonhydro', 'ihydro_region';
R3087: added type '5' b.c. for elev. and vel (combination of tides and *[23]D.th). For
       vel, also '-5' is similar to '-4'; 
R3084: added two new parameters for under resolution in a b-clinic model:
       'hw_depth' and 'hw_ratio' (Hannah-Wright-like ratio & depth to detect under resolution);
R3080: added 'ieos_pres' (/=0: add hydrostatic pressure effects in EOS);
R3073: added a new flow b.c. (ifltype=-2, iettype=0) for discharge-stage relation. If invoked, need

R2953: sediment.in: added dumping/dredging option in SED3D (ised_dump);
R2947: quads added in SED3D;
R2936: restored Shapiro filter as an option: 'ishapiro' and 'shapiro'. This option is normally used
       with indvel=ihorcon=0;
R2935: new parameters, 'rearth_pole', 'rearth_eq', 'iupwind_mom', 'hvis_coef0'; removed 'cdh'. In addition, 
       ihorcon=2 for bi-harmonic viscosity; hvis coefficients are specified in hvis_coef.gr3
       if ihorcon=1, and hvis_coef0 if ihorcon=2;
R2875: sediment.in, added a new parameter 'relath';
R2863: add nws=5,6 options (inputs: UVP.nc or UVP_direct.nc);

R2796: exposed tolerances for implicit TVD in param.in: 'eps1_tvd_imp' and 'eps2_tvd_imp';
R2792: added 'ieos_type' for type of Eq. of State used (0: original UNESCO; 1: linear function of T ONLY). If
       ieos_type=1, needs two new parameters: eos_[a,b] for linear function;
R2789: added 'sed_morph_time' in sediment.in;
R2768: restored Manning's friction option (bfric=-1) and related 'hmin_man'. Note that if you use this
       option, Manning's formula will be applied to ALL prisms including 3D ones;
R2687: (1) 'ntracers' replaced by that for each tracer model: ntracer_gen, ntracer_age, sed_class, eco_class 
           (for ICM it's hardwired to 23);
       (2) icst repaced by 'ic_TEM' and 'ic_SAL' (and they must be same); 
           i.c. flags for other tracer models are ic_[MOD]. The inputs for T,S are not changed (ts.ic etc),
           but for other tracers, it's [MOD]_hvar_[ID].ic or [MOD]_vvar_[ID].ic, where [ID] are local tracer #;
       (3) the transport method for all tracers is given by 'itr_met' (which replaces iupwind_t);
       (4) nudging option flags are now: inu_[MOD] (including T,S). The relax. inputs are: [MOD]_nudge.gr3.
           Type '2' inputs are [MOD]_nu.in, and step is 'step_nu_tr';
       (5) Output name changes for other tracers: [MOD]_[ID].6?. In general, model name is added to the old names
           (see param.in for other names);
       (5) removed: flag_model,flag_ic, iupwind_t,inu_st, inu_tr, step_nu, ntracers
       (6) changes in names of .th: [MOD]_[ID].th (for all tracers and type 1 b.c.; temp.th->TEM_1.th, 
           salt.th->SAL_1.th); [MOD]_3D.th (includes all local tracers in it for type 4 b.c., but all of these
           must use same time step!), and so
           temp3D.th->TEM_3D.th, salt3D.th->SAL_3D.th. msource.th should include _all_ tracers if enabled
           (e.g. GEN,  AGE);
       (7) In addition formats are changed for bctides.in and hotstart, if tracer modules are enabled (use combine_hotstart6.f90);
R2650: removed 'flimiter' and 'flimiter2' - TVD options need to be set in Makefile.local now;
R2648: removed 'tvd_mid*' (option for TVD formulations);
R2581: indvel=0 now works with quad/tri. The only remaining non-working option is inunfl=1;
R2559: removed 'inter_st' (ELM transport);
R2552: added ramp-up flags for source/sinks (nramp_ss and dramp_ss) if if_source=1;
R2549: removed ELM transport option (iupwind_t=0);
R2266: new format from quads2/. Obsolete parameters are listed near the end. Also quads does not work
       with indvel<=0. vgrid.in is
       now required even for 2D model (1 layer). Have not worked on any of other modules yet;
       Changed parameters: (1) bfric=-1 is removed (for 2D sides, log formula is used which assumes the total depth as the BBL);

R2237: depth.61 output redefined as the _change_ in depth from initial condition (i.e. hgrid.gr3);
R2208: add a new output file 'bdrc.61';
R2040: format change for msource.th and wind.th (nws=1,4);
R18xx: added 2 new outputs from SED3D: bthk.66 (total bed thickness in meters) and
       bage.66 (total bed ages in sec);
R1842: add GOTM4.0 in make. More tests are needed.
R1801: added a new parameter for tracer nudging: step_nu_tr (for inu_tr=2, which requires an input tr_nu.in); also ICM sed. outputs: bdoc.66,bnh4.66,bno3.66,bpo4.66,bcod.66,sbdo.66,sbsa.66;
R1790: added a new option for momentum bottom b.c. ibottom_bc=1 recovers old results; =2: solve
       mom. eq. from surface to true bottom.
R1781: added age calculation. New outputs are age_[1..N].63. Method: set ntracers=2*N, where
       N is # of age tracers (the tracer array is [c_1..c_N a_1..a_N], and age_i=a_i/c_i). 
       All i.c. =0; c_i=1, c_j=0 (j/=i), a_[1..N]=0 at relevant bnd(s), and itrtype=0 at ocean bnd;
R1699: .th now can have its own time step, but MUST start at t=0! Previously only wind.th can have its own dt;
R1587: added a new parameter: ishapiro_violation. If =0, no Shapiro filter violation check will be done.
R1577: (not param.in per se) added a few new parameters in vgrid.in for ivcor (types of z-coord. systems; 2 for SZ)
R1534: (merged with branch/selfe_opt1) tvd_mid, tvd_mid2, flimiter, flimiter2 should only be changed if CHOOSE_TVD is turned on;
R1495: added a new parameter (dzb_decay<=0) for friction option bfric=1.
       Under this option, Cd is calculated from log law when dzb>=dzb_min, and 
       Cdmax=Cd(dzb=dzb_min). When dzb<dzb_min, Cd=Cdmax*exp[dzb_decay*(1-dzb/dzb_min)].
       e.g, if dzb_decay=-3.4539, Cd(dzb=dzb_min/3)=0.1*Cdmax. Note that the old
       bfric=1 option can be recovered by setting dzb_decay=0;
R1460: corrected mis-spelt 'latitude';
R1405: 1 new parameter (hmin_radstress) used only for rad. stress calculation;
R1382: relaxed check for rmaxvel;
R1359: removed 'ishapiro'; it's set internally instead;

       must be present in param.in;
R1089: removed mass_source
R1038: added new parameter cdsed.61 for SED2D

R841: added a new parameter 'mass_source' to bypass mass source in transport;
R812: ics=2 and inter_mom>0 works now;
R747: replacd Cdmax with dzb_min for bfric=1 (roughness). With dzb_min=0.5m, the max Cd's are: 0.0022 (z0=0.1mm), 
      0.0034 (z0=0.5mm), 0.0041 (z0=1mm), 0.0061 (z0=3mm), 0.0075 (z0=5mm), 0.0105 (z0=1cm);
R744: added SED2D output parameters;
R513: add 2D Manning formulation inside code; bfric=-1 is the new option (needs hmin_man and manning.gr3). 2D model
      must use this option.
R473: new parameter: if_source (for pt source/sink);
R348: new parameter: irouse_test. Also mdc2,msc2,iwbl, iharind, flag_ic, flag_model and sim_* now must be present (even when not used);

---------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in other inputs:
(20) R2684: bctides: combined T,S and tracers b.c. flags into 1 line;
(19) R2570: removed xlsc.gr3 as input (itur=3), and set it at 0.1;
(18) R2266: vgrid.in is now required for 2D model;
(17) R2040: make all .th format consistent
            msource.th: all tracers are lumped into 1 line [ath3(1:nsources,1:2+ntracers,...)]; 
            wind.th (nws=1,4): add time stamp;
(16) R1850: SED3D input changes: (a) removed bedthick_overall from sediment.in and 
                                 added bedthick.ic (.gr3 format); (b)in addition, also need bed_frac_*.ic.
(15) R1813: renamed vvd.dat as vvd.in;
(14) R1699: .th now can have its own time step, but MUST start at t=0! Previously only wind.th can have its own dt;
(13) R1302: Moved tracer parameters from bctides.in to param.in: itr_met,tvd_mid2,flimiter2,inu_tr
(12) R1264:  SED2D part added to hotstart. Use combine_hotstart5.f90 for combining.
             hotstart.in is backward compatible for pure Hydro (i.e. no ICM or SED2D);
(11) R1225: changed tvd.gr3 and fluxflag.gr3 to .prop format;
(10) R1222: appled the change in R1219 to elev. and vel. nudging as well;
(9) R1219: changed relax. const. definition (suggested by Ben and Brett). The values in 
           [s,t,tracer]_nudg.gr3 will be multiplied by dt to get the final relax. const.
           One approach to calculate the values in these .gr3 files is: -log(0.1)/T90/86400, where
           T90 is the 90% decay time in days;
(8) R1019: fluxflag.gr3 now takes an arbitrary # of regions from -1,0...M. The code
           (with consv_check=1) will calculate the flux between 2 region numbers with difference=1, excluding region -1;
(7) R934: If running on Stampede, need an input 'die.stam' (temp. fix for cluster hang problem);
(6) R835: fluxflag.gr3 can now take an arbitrary # of regions from 0...M. The code
          (with consv_check=1) will calculate the lower triangle of the fluxes matrix. 
(5) R513: if bfric=-1 (2D model), needs manning.gr3 (Manning's n);
(4) R473: if if_source=1, need: source_sink.in, vsource.th, vsink.th, 
          and msource.th (volume sources and sinks are combined in the
          code, which is then ramped up with a rate 2x slower than main ramp if nramp=1; 
          no ramp for mass source);
(3) R3??: elev3D.th renamed as elev2D.th;
(2) R86: tvd.gr3 is needed if iupwind_t=2;
(1) R??: if ihydraulics/=0, need hydraulics.in 

---------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in outputs:
(1) R??: 3D profiles for station outputs;
(2) R147: commented out (1);
(3) R304: added non-standard outputs (*.67 etc) that users can also use.
          For side- or center-based outputs, combine_output6 needs sidecenters.gr3
          or centers.gr3;
(4) R881: add timer_comp() for generic use in compution-only portion of a routine for load balance analysis etc.
(5) R964: hotstart outputs changed to include additional arrays for ICM; hotstart.in is 
          backward compatible if USE_ICM is not on. Use combine_hotstart4.f90 for combining.
(6) R1469; consolidated many output files to reduce I/O footprint;
(7) R1776: hotstart outputs changed to include SED[23]D arrays; use combine_hotstart5.f90 for combining.

       WWM-III supports now WWIII, WAM and SWAN physics, where ST4 from WWIII is the default physics as used at NCEP/NOAA and ECMWF in the future. 
       The whole code was rewritten in terms efficiency, like chache locality + arrays allignement has been improved and so the scalibility of the code
       ASPAR_LOCAL from 1-10 was introduced to have influence of memory locality, e.g. for ASPAR_LOCAL_LEVEL = 1 as much as possible is precomputed 
       and using ASPAR_LOCAL_LEVEL = 10 u have basically everything computed on the fly. What the best is for the certain system and problem can be tested 
       by try and error for small computer systems and smaller problems ASPAR_LOCAL_LEVEL = 1-4 and for large scale problems 5-10. 
(62) R3932: Hydro/lap.F90, line 1663 has Mbound issue. Aron fixed it by declaring D[XY](N) in DCOPY and DDOT.
(63) R3945: switch to netcdf outputs; saved last binary output version as branches/v5.4
(64) R3976: added a new option for settling vel. (Richard Hofmeister).
(65) R4009: fixed a bug with ihot=2 introduced between R3285 and R3286 due to the removal of nramp_elev.
     Without it the results won't match. Reinstated nramp_elev and applied same fix to v5.4.
(66) R4116: (from Hai) changed the deposition mass calculation wrt age in SED3D
(67) R4118: finished netcdf related changes to I/O and scripts
(68) R4212: rest tempmin to -5C for ice module.
(69) R4273: added evap&precip into volume source.
(70) R4309: implicit treatment for vertical migration in itr_met>2
(71) R4407: bug fixes related to vortex force (wet/dry; index)

ICM notes:
(1) Point source input (ps.in) right now has a hard-wired dt of 1 day (starting from 0).
(2) R1147: a) nps (# of point sources) is now read in from wqparam.in (17th line with 16th being comment);
           b) renamed pselfe_sed_test_inp as icm_sed.in; removed COLDI and HOTI in 
              this file, and use ihot instead;

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
gnu make system:

To use Makefile, three files are needed:
mk/Make.defs.local, mk/Make.defs.config, and src/Makefile
The file mk/Make.defs.local should be written depending on different environment. 
Write your own env into mk/Make.defs.<your env name> (see mk/Make.defs.* from others as a reference),
 and copy or symlink it to mk/Make.defs.local. svn ci the first file (not the 2nd file). You can then toggle on/off
 modules using mk/Make.defs.local.

In addition, python is also needed.

To add a new CPP or module, need to update all 3 files (in the order shown above).

Pre-svn versions:
v3.0b:

v3.0c:
       (5) param.in:
           a) now include all parameters in tracer_param.in if ntracers/=0;
           b) if nonhydro=1, need ihydro_region to indicate if a hydrostatic region needs to
               be specified in hydro_region.gr3 (depth=1 in hydrostatic region);
           c) added station output option (iout_sta; if /=0 need nspool_sta and an input 'station.in');
           d) if USE_HA is turned on in Makefile, 'iharind' is needed to do harmonic analysis;
           e) new option imm=2;
           f) if NAPZD is used, 2 extra output flags: Bbdf.63 and totN.63;

v3.0d:
       (3) param.in:
           a) if WWM is used, add a coupling flag (icou_elfe_wwm=0: decoupled so 2 models
              will run independently); also an output flag 'Hsig.61';

v3.1a:
       (5) param.in:
          a) im2d added (1: 2D model);
          b) no long reset zcor.63 output flag;
          c) some parameters no longer matter for 2D model (see sample);
          d) 'Hsig.61' output added if USE_WWM;
          e) ics=2: sphericall coordinate option;
